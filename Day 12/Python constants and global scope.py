Remember, you should be careful with variables that have global scope,
but don't believe the people who tell you that you should never use global
scope. Global scope can be incredibly useful
especially when you're defining constants. Global constants
are variables which you define
and you're never planning on changing it ever again
"""
"""
To differentiate constants variables the naming convention in Python 
is to turn it into all uppercase.
